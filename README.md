# Crawler

This is a python based web crawler made for IEEE papers. 
It uses https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8301529 as the start point and recursively traverses through the reference papers and extracts abstract data from them until it obtains a prespecified number of papers. 

# Running Instructions 

Run the main.py python file and enter the number of papers that are needed to be scrapped.

An output CSV file will be generated containing the details of all the papers.
